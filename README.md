Rage Against the Machine Fan Site

Code for this can be found in the Prework_HS1 Repo under module 4.

It's strange writing the readme for this, because even though I completed this at the beginning of the year, I am writing this a month after I graduated from the coding bootcamp.

Looking back at the code, it's crazy to see how far I've come. This was built soley with html with CSS done directly on the html page. This was before I even knew what the Terminal on my MacBook was used for. I had no idea I could've saved a lot of time by using Bootstrap. My my file isn't even named index.html but rather ratm.html or fanpage.html.  There is no organization in my repo such as having an assets page and I believe the image path is taken from a webiste rather then what I do now which is to download the image and then use relative paths for that image or use React and import the image. Because this was a prework, I did a lot of searching on google for code or asking the TA's for help.

But this was the beginning of my coding journey and though now I could go back and make a much stronger webpage using Node and React, I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish.
